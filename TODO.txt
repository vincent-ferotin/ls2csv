ToDo (?)
========

*   Give errors an immutable ID,
    then print their ids before their messages,
    then add n new columns in CSV (optionable?) resuming all errors ids
    and for each node if it falls into any of them.
*   Tests! Unit tests! Functional tests!
*   Python3.x async/await.
*   Timestamp(s) of node's analysis
