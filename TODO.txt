ToDo (?)
========

*   Give errors an immutable ID,
    then print their ids before their messages,
    then add n new columns in CSV (optionable?) resuming all errors ids
    and for each node if it falls into any of them.
*   Tests! Unit tests! Functional tests!
*   Python3.x async/await.
*   Timestamp(s) of node's analysis
*   Set node' type even if not dir/file/symlink but `ls` output was well
    parsed: "r|M|n|p|s|c|b|D|?"
    and change NodeType values for strings.

    *   Only log if node's type is still unknonw.

*   Allow excluding relative path, e.g. ``.git``, ``cache/``, etc.
